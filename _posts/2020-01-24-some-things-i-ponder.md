Title: Some Things I Ponder
---

What if geese aren't afraid of car horns because they themselves are horns?

What if cookbook authors were called bookcooks?

Who was the first person to drink cow's milk (or any other animal's)?

Who created the first straight edge? Or the first 90 degree angle? And how did they know they were right?

If you play a musical instrument and listen to it through a sound system, the sound from the electronics probably reaches your ears faster than the acoustic sound.

Who was the first person to make coffee?

Everything you see was someone's job.

Whose job is it to orchestrate fireworks+music shows? And how do you get that job?

Why don't more people work from home?

Who came up with the word "bamboozle?"
