title: My Hope for the 2020 Election
---

My hope, not my politically informed analysis:

1. Trump wins re-election
2. Partisan hissy fits continue to be the standard in Washington
3. More people realize that government, and especially political parties, are not a great solution to most things
4. We arrive at the 2024 election with a reformed sense of conservatism - a strong skepticism towards government power

I don't think Trump has "drained the swamp" (what is the swamp, by the way? Washington? The state of public political discourse? Old media? All of the above?). I think he's doing something better. He's forcing us to _stare at it_ for an uncomfortable amount of time. To see how filthy and stagnant it can be, and to ask ourselves why we think it's ever going to be a diamond-studded swimming pool.
