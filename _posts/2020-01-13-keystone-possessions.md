[The Power of Habit](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-power-of-habit-charles-duhigg/1103588638?ean=9780812981605#/) by Charles Duhigg introduces the idea of "keystone habits" - habits that kickstart several other habits:

> Some habits, in other words, matter more than others in remaking businesses and lives. These are "keystone habits" ... The habits that matter most are the ones that, when they start to shift, disloadge and remake other patterns.

I wonder if we also have "keystone possessions" - possessions that encourage us to buy or keep more stuff than we really need.

My apartment has a dining space that I turned into a dining/office space, with the kitchen table on one side and my desk on the other. Normally my desk houses an iMac, a printer, a paper tray, a lot of junk mail and pocket change.

I recently decided to put away the printer and the iMac, just to see if I'd actually miss them. After seeing an empty desk for several days, I wondered if I needed it at all. I rarely need to spread out papers or books or anything other than a computer, so the kitchen table would work fine. Here's my new setup: one table right next to the kitchen that serves as both a dining table and a desk.

If I end up not liking this, I'll put it back the way it was. I have nothing against desks or nice desktop computers; I just don't know if I _need_ either one.
