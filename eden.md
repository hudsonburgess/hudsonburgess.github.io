<div class="poem">
Irreplaceable
Undeniable
Can hardly be described
It's our home
You alone
Can bring my soul to life
In the place you made me to be

Eden, Eden
The garden where meaning grows
Forever proclaimed
Never ashamed
To guide your children home
Light my path
This I ask:
Show me back to Eden

Unexplainable
Still attainable
With you by my side
All my sin
Forgiven
To bridge the great divide
And forge my way to...

Eden, Eden
The garden where meaning grows
Forever proclaimed
Make it my aim
To show the world their home
Light their path
This I ask:
Show us back to Eden

Your third testament --
We'll be part of it
When we've arrived in...

Eden, Eden
The garden where meaning grows
Forever proclaimed
All in your name
This world is not our home
It's Eden
